The vulnerabilities could allow an\nunauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system if the system exposes the\nservice to the network.\nAll Siemens Healthineers products from all business lines have been evaluated. Most Siemens Healthi-\nneers products are not affected by the vulnerabilities because they do not provide the option to activate\nthe Remote Desktop Service, implement other controls that mitigate the vulnerabilities, use a version of\nMicrosoft Windows that is not affected, or are not based on Microsoft Windows.\nThis advisory provides a full list of affected products from Siemens Healthineers and provides recommen-\ndations to mitigate the vulnerabilities."
