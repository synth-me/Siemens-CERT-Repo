The web server is disabled in the default settings and its use is\noptional. Use in a productive environment is discouraged.\n•Restrict access to to the device to the internal or VPN network. Further restrict access to the web\ninterface (80/tcp) and to the telnet port (23/tcp) to trusted IP addresses if possible.\n• Do not click on links from unknown sources.\n•Fixes for CVE-2018-13808 have also been released in versions V2.5.2.7, V2.6.2.2, V2.7.2.1 and\nV2.8 of CP 1616 and CP 1604: https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109768664"
