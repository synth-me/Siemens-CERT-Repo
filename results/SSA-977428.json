The web interface\nof SCALANCE M875 could allow Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS),\nor command injection attacks if an attacker is authenticated or tricks a legitimate authenticated user into\naccessing a malicious link.\nSiemens recommends customers to upgrade their hardware, and provides mitigations until hardware\nupgrades can be applied."
