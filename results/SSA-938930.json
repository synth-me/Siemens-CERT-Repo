        "text": "Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to\nbuild resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is\ntherefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are\nin place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the\ngrid design.\nSiemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling\nand documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated\nmeans to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly\nrecommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff\nof the update process in the target environment.\nAs a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate\nmechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to\nour operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.\nRecommended security guidelines to Digital Grid Products can be found at:\nhttps://www.siemens.com/gridsecurity\nSSA-938930 © Siemens 2020 Page 1 of 3\nSiemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT"
