The CPU will remain in DEFECT mode until manual restart.\nSuccessful exploitation requires an attacker to be able to send a specially crafted S7 communication\npacket to a communication interface of the CPU. This includes Ethernet, PROFIBUS, and Multi Point\nInterfaces (MPI). No user interaction or privileges are required to exploit the security vulnerability. The\nvulnerability could allow causing a Denial-of-Service condition of the core functionality of the CPU,\ncompromising the availability of the system.\nAt the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.\nSiemens conﬁrms the security vulnerability and provides mitigations to resolve the security issue."
