        "text": "McAfee has issued Security Bulletin SB10250 to address a vulnerabilty in McAfee Application and\nChange Control (MACC). SINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180 Drives with HMIs produced between\nNovember 4th, 2015 and October 9th, 2018, use MACC as part of their software package, if option A30\nwas part of the order.\nSiemens has analyzed the vulnerability and has determined that this vulnerability applies to these HMIs.\nHMIs with this vulnerability can be compromised via local attack using removable USB storage devices to\ntransfer malicious ﬁles. These ﬁle can be executed to compromise the HMI and by extension the drive\nsystem.\nFor compatibility reasons, Siemens advises the installation of MACC 8.2.0 instead of version 8.0.0, hotﬁx\n5 as mentioned in SB10250."
