If supported by the product, an automated\nmeans to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly\nrecommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff\nof the update process in the target environment.\nAs a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate\nmechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to\nour operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.\nRecommended security guidelines to Secure Substations can be found at:\nhttps://www.siemens.com/gridsecurity\nSSA-635129 © Siemens AG 2019 Page 2 of 4\nSiemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT"
