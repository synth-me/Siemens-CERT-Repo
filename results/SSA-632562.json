        "text": "The SIPROTEC 5 Ethernet plug-in communication modules and devices are affected by multiple security\nvulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to leverage various attacks, e.g. to execute\narbitrary code over the network.\nThe underlying Wind River VxWorks network stack is affected by eleven vulnerabilities known as ‘UR-\nGENT/11’. Of these, two DHCP-related vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-12257 and CVE-2019-12264) do not\napply to this advisory as the listed products use a different DHCP stack.\nOne further vulnerability affects the boot process of the device under certain conditions.\nSiemens has released updates and recommends that customers update to the new versions."

See https://www.windriver.com/security/\nannouncements/tcp-ip-network-stack-ipnet-urgent11/ for more information.\n•Use a ﬁrewall to block trafﬁc with IP-options SSRR (Strict Source and Record Route) or LSRR\n(Loose Source and Record Route) to mitigate CVE-2019-12256. See https://support2.windriver.\ncom/index.php?page=cve&on=view&id=CVE-2019-12256 for more information.\n•Use a ﬁrewall to block trafﬁc with destination port 443/TCP or activate the role-based access control\nfeature or the connection password feature in the device to mitigate CVE-2019-10938.\n•To resolve CVE-2019-10938 for SIPROTEC 5 CP300 and CP100 CPU variant update to ﬁrmware\nversion V7.90 or higher and update DIGSI 5 to V7.90 or higher from https://support.industry.siemens.\ncom/cs/ww/en/ and activate the client authorization feature.

        "text": "Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to build\nresilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is\ntherefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are\nin place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the\ngrid design.\nSiemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling\nand documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated\nmeans to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly\nrecommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff\nof the update process in the target environment.\nAs a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate\nmechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to\nour operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.\nRecommended security guidelines to Secure Substations can be found at:\nhttps://www.siemens.com/gridsecurity"
