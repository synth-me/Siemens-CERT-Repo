These versions disable the web\ninterface by default, as it is no longer needed in standard use cases.\n•Climatix POL908 is designed to be operated in protected BACnet/IP networks only. Do not connect\nit to other networks, such as an Ofﬁce LAN or the Internet. Also consider to remove POL908,\nin case the integrated BACnet/IP implementation in newer versions of Climatix 600 controllers is\nalready sufﬁcient for your environment.\nThe remaining mitigation measures apply only, if the web interface is activated (e.g. via the Climatix\nSCOPE tool):\n•Climatix POL909: When conﬁguring your custom web application, disable the access to the default\nweb pages provided by POL909\n•Enforce authentication for the web interface, and change the default password of the standard\nADMIN user\n• Disable JavaScript within the web browser used to access the web server of Climatix POL908\n• Utilize a modern web browser with integrated XSS ﬁltering mechanisms"
