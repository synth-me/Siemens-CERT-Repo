        "text": "Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to\nreduce the risk:\n•Until patches can be applied by the customer support and for end-of-support products, Siemens\nHealthineers recommends to isolate affected products that are listening on network ports 139/tcp,\n445/tcp or 3389/tcp from any infected system within its respective network segment (e.g. by ﬁrewall\nblocking access to above network ports.)\n• If the above cannot be implemented we recommend the following:\n•If patient safety and treatment is not at risk, disconnect the uninfected product from the network and\nuse in standalone mode.\n•Reconnect the product only after the provided patch or remediation is installed on the system.\nSiemens Healthineers is able to patch systems capable of Remote Update Handling (RUH) much\nfaster by remote software distribution compared to onsite visits. Therefore customers of RUH\ncapable equipment are recommended to clarify the situation concerning patch availability and\nremaining risk in the local customer network with the Siemens Customer Care Center ﬁrst and\nthen to re-connect their systems in order to receive patches as fast as possible via Remote Update\nHandling. This ensures smooth and fast receipt of updates and therefore supports reestablishment\nof system operations."
