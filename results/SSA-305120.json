This may include unauthen-\nticated ﬁrmware installation, remote code execution and leakage of conﬁdential data like passwords.\nSiemens has released updates to introduce authentication to the web application. It is still recommended\nto implement further mitigations, as most of the vulnerabilities might not be sufﬁciently mitigated by this."

        "text": "Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to\nreduce the risk:\n•The ﬁrmware updates to SICAM T and SICAM MMU introduce authentication to the web application\nand remove some unnecessary functionality. The web authentication functionality reduces the risk\nof access to the device’s web application for executing administrative commands by unauthenticated\nusers.\n•Due to hardware constraints, encryption is not possible on the devices. Conﬁdential data such as\npasswords handled by the devices need to be protected on the network by other means, e.g. by\nVPN.\n•The risk for remote code execution and unauthenticated ﬁrmware installation can be mitigated by\nensuring encryption and authentication between the user and the device, e.g. by VPN.\n•Using a modern and up to date browser while accessing the web application might reduce the risk\nof Cross-Site-Scripting attacks.\nSSA-305120 © Siemens 2020 Page 1 of 5\nSiemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT"

        "text": "Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to\nbuild resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is\ntherefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are\nin place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the\ngrid design.\nSiemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling\nand documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated\nmeans to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly\nrecommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff\nof the update process in the target environment.\nAs a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate\nmechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to\nour operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.\nRecommended security guidelines to Digital Grid Products can be found at:\nhttps://www.siemens.com/gridsecurity"
