        "text": "Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling\nand documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated\nmeans to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly\nrecommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff\nof the update process in the target environment.\nAs a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate\nmechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to\nour operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.\nRecommended security guidelines to Secure Substations can be found at:\nhttps://www.siemens.com/gridsecurity\nSSA-104088 © Siemens AG 2019 Page 2 of 4\nSiemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT"

A manual restart is required to recover the EN100 module functionality of the affected\ndevices.\nSuccessful exploitation requires an attacker with network access to send multiple packets to the\naffected products or modules. As a precondition the IEC 61850-MMS communication needs to be\nactivated on the affected products or modules. No user interaction or privileges are required to exploit\nthe vulnerability.
