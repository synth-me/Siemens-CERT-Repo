If\ntime synchronization is performed using NTP , then port 123/udp must be opened on the ﬁrewall. If\ntime synchronization is performed using SIMATIC time synchronization, then port 22223/udp and\nport 22224/udp must be opened on the ﬁrewall.\nFor conﬁguring parameters, it is recommended to use a direct connection to the SICLOCK TC.\n•Apply the cell protection concept, and apply defense-in-depth: https://www.siemens.com/cert/\noperational-guidelines-industrial-security"
